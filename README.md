# Shiny App

This repository contains a Shiny app that showcases a scatter plot visualization based on user input.

## Installation

To run this Shiny app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file.
2. Make sure you have R and the required packages installed.
3. Open R or RStudio.

5. Install the necessary packages by running `install.packages(c("shiny", "ggplot2"))`.
6. Run the app by executing `shiny::runApp()`.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can interact with it using the provided user interface. The app allows you to select the X and Y axes for the scatter plot and choose the point color. The plot will be updated dynamically based on your selections.

## Files

The repository includes the following files:

- `server.R`: This file contains the server-side code of the Shiny app. It loads data, constructs the plot, and defines the app's behavior.

- `ui.R`: This file contains the user interface code of the Shiny app. It defines the layout and components of the app, including input controls and output elements.

## Dependencies

The Shiny app relies on the following R packages:

- shiny: Provides the framework for building interactive web applications in R.
- ggplot2: Offers powerful visualization capabilities, used here to create the scatter plot.

Make sure you have these packages installed before running the app.
